1) Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)?

	#1 	Create View Dailyorders
		as Select Distinct cnum, snum, onum, odate from Orders;
	ans:-	No, bacuse of distinct it will not be updateable

	#2 	Create View Custotals
		as Select cname, Sum (amt) Sum_Amt from Orders, Customers
		where Orders.cnum=Customers.cnum
		Group by cname;
	ans;-	no, join can't be updateable.

	#3	Create view Thirdorders
		as Select * from Dailyorders where
		odate=’1990-10-03’;
	ans:- 	no, it using view of dailyorders and dailyorders is not updateable.

	#4 	Create view Nullcities
		as Select snum, sname, city
		from Salespeople
		where city is NULL
		OR sname BETWEEN ‘A’ and ‘MZ’;
	ans:-	yes

2) Create a view of the Salespeople table called Commissions. This view will include
only the snum and comm fields. Through this view, someone could enter or change
commissions, but only to values between .10 and .20.
query:-	 create view v_sal_comm as
	 select * from salespeople;
 	 select snum , comm from salespeople
	 where comm between .10 and .20;

3) Some SQL implementations have a built-in constant representing the current date,
sometimes called “CURDATE” or “SYSDATE”. The word SYSDATE can
therefore be used in a SQL statement, and be replaced by the current date when the
value is accessed by commands such as Select or Insert. We will use a view of the
Orders table called Entryorders to insert rows into the Orders table. Create the
Orders table, so that SYSDATE is automatically inserted for odate if no value is
given. Then create the Entryorders view so that no values can be given. 
query:-
	create table ORDERSnew
(
	Onum INT(4),
	Amt FLOAT(7,2),
	Odate DATE default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	Cnum INT(4),
	Snum INT(4),
    constraint pk_onum primary key(onum)
);

create view Entryorders as 
select * from ORDERSnew;
