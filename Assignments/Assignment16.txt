1. Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the
Orders table quickly.
query:-select * from orders group by odate;

2. If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be
unique (assume all current values are unique)?
Ans:- We can do using the UNIQUE KEY constraint or the PRIMARY KEY constraint.

3. Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders
grouped by date quickly.
query:- 	create index i_orders_odate on orders(odate);
	show index from orders;

4. Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating,
and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.
query:-	alter table customers 
	modify rating constraint rate_pk PRIMARY KEY;
