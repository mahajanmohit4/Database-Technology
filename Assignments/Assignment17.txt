1. Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of cnum and snum
are different from one another, and so that NULL values are excluded from the date field.
query:-	create table order_new (
	onum int,
	cnum int,
	snum int,
	odate date not null,
	constrain pk_orders primary key (onum,cnum,snum)
	);

2. Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted,
snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically between A and M, inclusive (assume
all names will be uppercase).
query:-	create table salespeople_new (
	snum int not null primary key,
	sname varchar(20) check (substr(upper(sname),1,1) between 'A' AND 'M'),
	city varchar(10) ,
	comm float(7,2) not null default 0.10
	);

3. Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and the cnum is
greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.
query:-	create table orders_new(
	onum int not null, 
	amt float(7,2) not null, 
	odate date, 
	cnum int not null, 
	snum int not null, 
	check(onum>cnum AND cnum>snum) 
	);
