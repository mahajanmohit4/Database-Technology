1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named
Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).
query:-
select  cname, onum from customers c, orders o
where o.cnum = c.cnum and c.cnum = ( select  cnum from customers where cname = 'Cisneros');

2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have
above-average orders.
query:-	Select max(c.cname), max(c.rating), o.cnum
	from orders o, customers c
	where o.cnum = c.cnum
	group by o.cnum
	having count(o.cnum)>(SELECT  (count(cnum)-count(distinct(cnum)))/2 from orders);

3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.
query:-	select snum , sum(amt) from orders
	group by snum
	having sum(amt) > (select max(amt) from orders);
